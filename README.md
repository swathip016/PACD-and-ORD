Photoacoustic Circular Dichroism (PACD) and Optical Rotary Dispersion (ORD) via Microfluidic Platforms

Optical activity in chiral materials plays a fundamental role in advancing our understanding of lightâ€“matter interactions and the development of next-generation optical devices. While conventional chiroptical techniquesâ€”such as circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopyâ€”are commonly used to probe biomolecular structures in the UVâ€“Visible range, they are often limited by scattering, diffraction, and shallow penetration depths.

This project explores a new direction by leveraging photoacoustics, which convert absorbed optical energy into acoustic signals, enabling:

-Enhanced signal sensitivity

-Deeper penetration in scattering media

-Compatibility with microfluidic environments

ðŸ”¬ What We Did
We investigated the PACD response of two optically active systems:

D-glucose in the NIR-II range (1400â€“1600 nm)

Naproxen (a common NSAID) in the 1300â€“1600 nm range

Measurements were performed using a microfluidic device with a 700 Âµm channel and a sample volume of only 0.3 mL.

ðŸ”§ Applications and Future Work

The combination of optical and acoustic methods paves the way for:

-Label-free detection in complex biological environments

-Miniaturized lab-on-a-chip systems for biosensing and diagnostics

-New tools in analytical chemistry and nanophotonics
