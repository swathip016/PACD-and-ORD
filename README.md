Photoacoustic Circular Dichroism (PACD) and Optical Rotary Dispersion (ORD) via Microfluidic Platforms

Optical activity in chiral materials plays a fundamental role in advancing our understanding of lightâ€“matter interactions and the development of next-generation optical devices. While conventional chiroptical techniquesâ€”such as circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopyâ€”are commonly used to probe biomolecular structures in the UVâ€“Visible range, they are often limited by scattering, diffraction, and shallow penetration depths.

This project explores a new direction by leveraging photoacoustics, which convert absorbed optical energy into acoustic signals, enabling:

-Enhanced signal sensitivity

-Deeper penetration in scattering media

-Compatibility with microfluidic environments
