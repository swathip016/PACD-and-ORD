Photoacoustic Circular Dichroism (PACD) and Optical Rotary Dispersion (ORD) via Microfluidic Platforms

Optical activity in chiral materials plays a fundamental role in advancing our understanding of light–matter interactions and the development of next-generation optical devices. While conventional chiroptical techniques—such as circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy—are commonly used to probe biomolecular structures in the UV–Visible range, they are often limited by scattering, diffraction, and shallow penetration depths.

This project explores a new direction by leveraging photoacoustics, which convert absorbed optical energy into acoustic signals, enabling:

-Enhanced signal sensitivity

-Deeper penetration in scattering media

-Compatibility with microfluidic environments
